One Life Challenge

This is an Openplanet plugin for Trackmania (2020) which implements a gamemode inspired by Jumper471's viewer challenge issued to GranaDy, as seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRhDQmoTmz4). 

The Rules

- You have "one life". Respawning to a checkpoint or retiring the run will reset your points to zero.
- Completing random maps from Trackmania Exchange, you will get one point for completing a map, plus one additional point per medal achieved.

No Medal - 1 point  
Bronze Medal - 2 points  
Silver Medal - 3 points  
Gold Medal - 4 points  
Author Medal - 5 points  

- You may skip any map with an author medal time longer than 3 minutes.

Your PB will automatically be updated as you complete runs, but make sure to retire or click the Stop button to save your score before ending a run to make sure it is saved between sessions.

GLHF!
